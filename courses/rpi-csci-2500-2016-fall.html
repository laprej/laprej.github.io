<h3 id="grading-and-other-class-policies">Grading and Other Class Policies</h3>

<ul>
<li> 4%: Problem of the day</li>
<li> 10%: Lab sections</li>
<li> 35%: 7 homeworks, 5 pts each -- due every other Tuesday.</li>
<li> 42%: 7 quizzes, 6 pts each, given in class every other Friday.</li>
<li>  9%: 1 project.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We will also be using Submitty (AKA the homework server).  Stay tuned.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Attendance Policy</strong>: Attendance at lectures is not required, but
be aware that I may include material not necessarily covered in the
text or on the web page.  You are responsible for all announcements
made in lecture (e.g., any change in due dates).
Additionally, you <em>are</em> responsible for the <strong>problem of the day</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Problem of the day</strong>: Each day in lecture you are to turn in the problem assigned from the previous lecture.
Students are excused from handing this in on quiz days; turn it in at the beginning of the following lecture.
The twist is that actually solving the problem is optional, i.e., you will receive full credit by simply putting your name on the page.
With a very high likelihood, students actually attempting to solve the problem will achieve a deeper understanding of the material than those that simply write their name on the paper.</p>

<p><strong>Lab Sections</strong>: Lab attendance is mandatory and you will be graded.
Keeping up with the labs will be the best way for your to make sure that you do not fall behind.</p>

<p><strong>Late Assignments Policy</strong>: Three late days are permitted for assignments.
They will be consumed in whole day increments. In other words, if you are one hour late, that will
count as one day. 25 hours late will count as two days, etc. Once these are exhausted, late assignments
will not be graded.</p>

<p><strong>Grade Disputes</strong>: Grade disputes must be made within 10 days.
After 10 days has elapsed, the grade on record will stand.</p>

<p><strong>Grade Modifiers Policy</strong>: Grade modifiers will be used in this
class. Nominally, for example, you expect to earn a B- if your score
is greater than 79.5 and less than 83.0, B if your score is greater
than 83 and less than 86, B+ if your score is greater than 86 and less
than 89.5. The same modifier points occur for the A, C and D ranges
except that there is no A+ nor is a D- allowed under the RPI Grade
Modifier Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Assignment Grading Criteria</strong>: Programming assignments are graded
as follows: 15% for proper comments (e.g., each function should
indicate what it does) and 85% for a correct working
implementation. We typically divide the correctness points over key
functions working. For example, reading - worth 10 points,
writing -- worth 10 points as file correctly, and then doing the
calculation correctly -- worth 65 points. Note that programs that
either don&#39;t compile or generate a <code>core dump</code> typically get no more
than 20 points of the 85. Thus, your max score for a &quot;properly
commented&quot; program that fails in some fundamental way is only 35
points even if you spent 100 hours of time on it.  Non-programming
assignments/homeworks are graded on a per-problems basis. Typically 5
problems will be given and each is worth 20 points.
These should be typed up using a word processor of your choice e.g., MS Word, LaTeX, etc.</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>While I strongly encourage you to form study groups and work
together in learning this material, the course project, homeworks and
programming assignments are to be done individually unless otherwise
noted by the assignment/project specification. What this means is that
you should do whatever is necessary to ensure your work remains your
work. For example, in doing programming assignments you might want to
prepend variable names with your initials. If during in the grading
process, it is determined that students shared or duplicated work,
those students will automatically take a zero for the offense plus a 5
point total average deduction. For a second offense, the student or
students involved will fail this course and a report will be sent to
the Dean of Students office which could result in additional
disciplinary action.</p>

<h3 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h3>

<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply the concepts of the C programming language to the
construction of moderately complex software implementation problems.</li>
<li>Apply the concepts of assembly language to correct and efficient translation
of a given C programming language into the course required assembly language(s).</li>
<li>Apply the concepts of integer and floating point formats to convert
from the base-10 integer or scientific format into the correct machine
readable binary format.</li>
<li>Apply the concepts of Boolean Algebra to simplify given Boolean equations.</li>
<li>Apply the concepts of K-Maps to the problem of Boolean expression simplification.</li>
<li>Apply the concepts of Performance to the analysis of computer performance problems.</li>
<li>Apply the concepts of a multi-cycle datapath and control by showing in
written form the processing steps that different classes of
instructions require as they move through the datapath and control
hardware structures.</li>
<li>Apply the concepts of a pipelined datapath and control by showing in
written form the processing steps that different classes of
instructions require as they move through the datapath and control
hardware structures.</li>
<li>Apply the concepts of caching and memory hierarchy to solve a problem which
requires you to design the &quot;best&quot; cache system given particular
design constraints.</li>
<li>Apply the concepts of parallel programming to the construction/implementation
of a correct and efficiently executing multi-threaded program.</li>
